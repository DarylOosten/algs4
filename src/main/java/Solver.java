/**
 * Part 1, assignment 4, 8puzzle.
 * 
 * Write a program to solve the 8-puzzle problem (and its natural
 * generalizations) using the A* search algorithm.
 * 
 * The problem. The 8-puzzle problem is a puzzle invented and popularized by
 * Noyes Palmer Chapman in the 1870s. It is played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8
 * square blocks labeled 1 through 8 and a blank square. Your goal is to
 * rearrange the blocks so that they are in order, using as few moves as
 * possible. You are permitted to slide blocks horizontally or vertically into
 * the blank square. A critical optimization. Best-first search has one annoying
 * feature: search nodes corresponding to the same board are enqueued on the
 * priority queue many times. To reduce unnecessary exploration of useless
 * search nodes, when considering the neighbors of a search node, don't enqueue
 * a neighbor if its board is the same as the board of the previous search node.
 * 
 * Game tree. One way to view the computation is as a game tree, where each
 * search node is a node in the game tree and the children of a node correspond
 * to its neighboring search nodes. The root of the game tree is the initial
 * search node; the internal nodes have already been processed; the leaf nodes
 * are maintained in a priority queue; at each step, the A* algorithm removes
 * the node with the smallest priority from the priority queue and processes it
 * (by adding its children to both the game tree and the priority queue).
 * 8puzzle game tree
 * 
 * Detecting infeasible puzzles. Not all initial boards can lead to the goal
 * board. To detect such situations, use the fact that boards are divided into
 * two equivalence classes with respect to reachability: (i) those that lead to
 * the goal board and (ii) those that lead to the goal board if we modify the
 * initial board by swapping any pair of adjacent (non-blank) blocks in the same
 * row. (Difficult challenge for the mathematically inclined: prove this fact.)
 * To apply the fact, run the A* algorithm simultaneously on two puzzle
 * instancesâ€”one with the initial board and one with the initial board modified
 * by swapping a pair of adjacent blocks in the same row. Exactly one of the two
 * will lead to the goal board.
